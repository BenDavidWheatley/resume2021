        <h3>profile</h3>
          <p>I started to re-train as a web developer in 2020 when Covid caused my current job as a furniture maker/designer to cease. It allowed me to re-think my career and be a part of something that is future proof. I exercise a high attention to detail to maintain accuracy and consistency in my personal performance, collaborative teamwork and on-time completion of all projects. Moreover, I offer customer service abilities and problem-solving. Although it is a career change, there are a lot of skills that I am able to transfer over. In 2017 I completed a project management course with The University of Cape Town. I have experience running large projects (from conception through to completion), large teams, working with the client to bring their ideas to life and I also understand the complexities of running a small business. </p>
